# Miami Heat Blog using Django

## Description

This is my first Django project, I really enjoyed using this library because it gives you a lot of power and can save you a lot of valuable time building a web application. My goal was to create a blog about my favorite team in the NBA, the Miami Heat. My biggest challenge was building the comment section, I spent a lot of time trying to understand how to use Django Forms, create Views and how I could link the comment to a post.
